# Turbulent flux over land and sea as a Kelvin wave propagates through different phases of the MJO

This repository contains all the code I used to finish my final research project for my Air-Sea Interaction course on Fall 2023 at UAlbany, SUNY. The repository contains the following

* Jupyter Notebooks containing my Python codes to calculate the momentum, heat, and moisture flux for a Kelvin wave propagating through different phases of the MJO at 80 degrees longitude
* Other files used to download and process daily mean wind, temperature, and specific humidity data from ERA5 at multiple pressure levels
* My final research paper
